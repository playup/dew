  # An AMI is an image file used as a template to create an instance.
  #
  # AMIs aren't shared between regions. You'll need to specify an AMI for each
  # region you want to create your environment in. AMIs can be created
  # with the script/ami.rb create command.
  #
  # These AMIs, however, are 32-bit Ubuntu 10.10 images from Canonical.
  # See: http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/10.10/release
